# Hackseries-Ridesharing
 Problem:
Traditional ridesharing platforms (like Uber, Ola, etc.) are centralized, meaning:

They control pricing, often taking high commissions from drivers.

Riders and drivers must trust a single company with sensitive data.

There's no transparency in ride fares, driver ratings, or data use.

Censorship or bans on users can happen without explanation.

No way for drivers or users to own part of the platform they contribute to.
