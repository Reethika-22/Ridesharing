# Ridesharing
 Problem:
Traditional ridesharing platforms (like Uber, Ola, etc.) are centralized, meaning:

They control pricing, often taking high commissions from drivers.

Riders and drivers must trust a single company with sensitive data.

There's no transparency in ride fares, driver ratings, or data use.

Censorship or bans on users can happen without explanation.

No way for drivers or users to own part of the platform they contribute to.

Web3-Based Solution:
A decentralized ridesharing platform powered by blockchain solves these issues:

Built on smart contracts to automate payments, bookings, and reviews — no middlemen.

Uses crypto wallets for login and payment — no need for banks or cards.

Fair revenue share — drivers keep more of what they earn.

Transparent data on rides, payments, and ratings — all on-chain.

Key Features of Web3 Ridesharing Platform

1. Decentralized Booking System
No central authority — rides are matched using smart contracts.
Peer-to-peer (P2P) interaction between drivers and riders.
2. Smart Contract Payments
Automatic, trustless payment system.
Ride fare is locked in a smart contract and released after trip completion.
Supports crypto payments (ETH, stablecoins, etc.).
3. Crypto Wallet Login
Users and drivers authenticate using wallets (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect).
No need for emails, passwords, or OTPs.
4. Transparent Fare Calculation
Fare logic is public and encoded in smart contracts.
No surge pricing manipulation.
5. Decentralized Identity (DID)
Riders and drivers have verifiable credentials on-chain.
Prevents fraud and fake profiles.
6. Reputation System on Blockchain
Ratings and reviews are stored on-chain.
Immutable and tamper-proof feedback.
7. Tokenized Incentives
Earn governance or reward tokens for participating (riding, driving, referring).
Tokens can be used to vote on platform decisions.
8. Data Privacy
No central server storing personal or location data.
Users control what they share using Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) or IPFS
9. Geo-location Integration (Off-chain + Oracles)
Rides matched based on real-world locations using oracle data.
Hybrid system to connect blockchain with real-time GPS info.
10. Community Governance (DAO)
Token holders can propose and vote on new features or rule changes.
Platform evolves based on community decisions.
11. NFT Driver Badges
Drivers can earn unique NFTs for milestones (5-star driver, 1000 rides, etc.).
Build trust and driver reputation visually.
12. Dispute Resolution via DAO or Escrow Contract
Issues resolved using decentralized mechanisms or community vote.
Funds held in escrow until dispute is settled.
Community-owned: drivers and riders can get governance tokens, giving them a say in how the platform runs.

# Ridesharing

Welcome to your new AlgoKit project!

This is your workspace root. A `workspace` in AlgoKit is an orchestrated collection of standalone projects (backends, smart contracts, frontend apps and etc).

By default, `projects_root_path` parameter is set to `projects`. Which instructs AlgoKit CLI to create a new directory under `projects` directory when new project is instantiated via `algokit init` at the root of the workspace.

## Getting Started

To get started refer to `README.md` files in respective sub-projects in the `projects` directory.

To learn more about algokit, visit [documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/algokit.md).

### GitHub Codespaces

To get started execute:

1. `algokit generate devcontainer` - invoking this command from the root of this repository will create a `devcontainer.json` file with all the configuration needed to run this project in a GitHub codespace. [Run the repository inside a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) to get started.
2. `algokit init` - invoke this command inside a github codespace to launch an interactive wizard to guide you through the process of creating a new AlgoKit project
