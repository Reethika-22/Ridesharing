# Hackseries-Ridesharing
 Problem:
Traditional ridesharing platforms (like Uber, Ola, etc.) are centralized, meaning:

They control pricing, often taking high commissions from drivers.

Riders and drivers must trust a single company with sensitive data.

There's no transparency in ride fares, driver ratings, or data use.

Censorship or bans on users can happen without explanation.

No way for drivers or users to own part of the platform they contribute to.

Web3-Based Solution:
A decentralized ridesharing platform powered by blockchain solves these issues:

Built on smart contracts to automate payments, bookings, and reviews — no middlemen.

Uses crypto wallets for login and payment — no need for banks or cards.

Fair revenue share — drivers keep more of what they earn.

Transparent data on rides, payments, and ratings — all on-chain.

Community-owned: drivers and riders can get governance tokens, giving them a say in how the platform runs.
