# 🚗 Web3 Ride Sharing DApp

A decentralized, transparent, and community-governed ridesharing platform built using blockchain technology. This DApp empowers riders and drivers to interact directly — no intermediaries, no unfair commissions, just trustless travel.

---

## 🔍 Problem

Traditional ridesharing platforms (like Uber, Ola, etc.) are centralized, meaning:

They control pricing, often taking high commissions from drivers.

Riders and drivers must trust a single company with sensitive data.

There's no transparency in ride fares, driver ratings, or data use.

Censorship or bans on users can happen without explanation.

No way for drivers or users to own part of the platform they contribute to.


## ✅ Solution

A decentralized ridesharing platform powered by blockchain solves these issues:

Built on smart contracts to automate payments, bookings, and reviews — no middlemen.

Uses crypto wallets for login and payment — no need for banks or cards.

Fair revenue share — drivers keep more of what they earn.

Transparent data on rides, payments, and ratings — all on-chain.

# Ridesharing

Welcome to our new AlgoKit project!

This is your workspace root. A `workspace` in AlgoKit is an orchestrated collection of standalone projects (backends, smart contracts, frontend apps and etc).

By default, `projects_root_path` parameter is set to `projects`. Which instructs AlgoKit CLI to create a new directory under `projects` directory when new project is instantiated via `algokit init` at the root of the workspace.

## Getting Started

To get started refer to `README.md` files in respective sub-projects in the `projects` directory.

To learn more about algokit, visit [documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/algokit.md).

### GitHub Codespaces

To get started execute:

1. `algokit generate devcontainer` - invoking this command from the root of this repository will create a `devcontainer.json` file with all the configuration needed to run this project in a GitHub codespace. [Run the repository inside a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) to get started.
2. `algokit init` - invoke this command inside a github codespace to launch an interactive wizard to guide you through the process of creating a new AlgoKit project
